## Introduction

This portfolio website is a personal project that demonstrates my skills in web development.  I used HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

Check out the live website [here](https://danijounblat1.github.io/portfolio/).

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for viewing on any device, including desktops and mobile phones.
- **Interactive Elements**: Add descriptions of any interactive features in your portfolio (e.g., animations, buttons).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Standard markup language for creating web pages.
- **CSS3**: Cascading Style Sheets for styling the website's appearance.
